# Custom Exploit Modules

This directory contains custom **Exploit** modules for the Metasploit Framework. This is the core of the arsenal, where theory becomes practice.

> An exploit module's primary goal is to leverage a vulnerability in a target system to gain unauthorized access. A successful exploit typically results in a **session**, such as a Meterpreter or command shell, giving you control over the target.

### ⚠️ Ethical and Legal Warning

**EXTREME CAUTION ADVISED.** Exploit modules are powerful tools designed to gain control over systems.
* **NEVER** use these modules on any system or network for which you do not have explicit, written permission from the owner.
* Unauthorized access to computer systems is a serious crime with severe consequences.
* All modules in this repository must be used strictly for authorized security research, penetration testing, and education.

### Purpose of This Directory

This directory is intended to store exploit modules that are:
- **Developed for new vulnerabilities** (0-days or N-days without a public module).
- **Ported from Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts** found online (e.g., converting a Python or Ruby script into a fully-featured Metasploit module).
- **Modified** to bypass specific security controls like Antivirus (AV) or an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
- **Custom-built** for proprietary applications or unique engagement scenarios.

### How to Use Modules in This Directory

1.  **Place Your Module**: Add your custom exploit module file (e.g., `my_exploit.rb`) into an appropriate subdirectory. It is best practice to categorize them by platform and service (e.g., `windows/smb/`).
2.  **Load the Path in `msfconsole`**: To load all custom modules (exploits, auxiliary, and post), point Metasploit to the parent `custom_modules` directory.
    ```
    msf > loadpath /path/to/your/repo/metasploit-arsenal/custom_modules
    msf > reload_all
    ```
3.  **Use Your Module**: Search for your module, configure the options (`RHOSTS`, `LHOST`, `PAYLOAD`, etc.), and run it.
    ```
    msf > use exploit/windows/smb/my_exploit
    msf > set RHOSTS IP_TARGET
    msf > exploit
    ```
