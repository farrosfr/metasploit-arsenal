# Metasploit Resource Script: Flexible Listener
#
# This script starts a multi/handler using variables (PAYLOAD, LHOST, LPORT)
# that are expected to be set *before* this script is executed.
# This makes it a reusable template for any listener.

# Use the generic handler module
use exploit/multi/handler

# Run the listener as a background job using the pre-set variables.
exploit -j

# Display active jobs to confirm the listener is running.
